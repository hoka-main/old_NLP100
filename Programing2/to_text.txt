At a press conference on March 3, New York City Commissioner of Health Oxiris Barbot said "We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives".[446] On March 4, she said: "There’s no indication that being in a car, being in the subways with someone who’s potentially sick is a risk factor."[447] On March 5 she said that New Yorkers without symptoms should not have to quarantine.[447] On March 20 Barbot warned that masks should only be used by people who are showing symptoms, saying: "The time to use a mask is when someone is symptomatic, when they’re coughing, when they’re sneezing, and it’s to ensure that that individual doesn’t contaminate other folks. It gives people who are asymptomatic a false sense of security that if they wear this mask, they don’t have to wash their hands, they don’t have to cover their mouths and their noses when they cough or they sneeze."[448] In early April, New York City Councilmen Democrat Robert Holden and Republican Eric Ulrich wrote to Mayor de Blasio asking him to relieve Barbot of her position "before it’s too late," saying her guidance on coronavirus had been disastrous.[447]

March 13, State of Emergency[492]
Ohio
Main article: COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio § Government response

COVID-19 Cases by counties of Ohio
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine was one of the first state governors to "sound the alarm" about the coronavirus threat, taking action before Ohio had many confirmed cases.[493] Axios called him "among the leading governors in the country sounding the alarm about the threat of the coronavirus."[493] The Washington Post called his and Department of Health director Amy Acton's response "a national guide to the crisis", pointing out numerous occasions when moves taken by Ohio were soon followed by other states.[494]

On March 3, when the state had no confirmed cases, Governor Mike DeWine cancelled the Arnold Classic, a move which the Washington Post said seemed radical at the time.[494]

On March 9, DeWine declared a state of emergency, when the state had 3 cases.[495] On March 11, he advised the state's colleges to go to online classes.[496]

On March 12, DeWine announced that all schools from K-12 would close for a 10-week break, starting March 16[497] and the state instituted a ban on gatherings of more than 100, with exemptions for airports, workplaces, restaurants, religious gatherings, weddings, and funerals.[498]

On March 15, DeWine and Acton ordered the suspension of dine-in service at all bars and restaurants,[499] and the following day closed bowling alleys, fitness centers, gyms, movie theaters, public recreation centers, trampoline parks, and water parks, and banned gatherings of more than 50 people.[500][501] Late on Monday the 16th, Acton called off the primary election scheduled for the following day.[502][496]

On March 17, DeWine ordered that elective surgeries be postponed.[503]

On March 18 DeWine closed barbershops, salons, and tattoo parlors[496] and announced closing of most BMV locations, asking the state legislature to pass a grace period for people whose licenses expired.[504] Businesses that remained open were advised to monitor employees' temperatures.[505] Mayor Andrew Ginther declared a state of emergency in Columbus, Ohio.[506]

On March 19 Governor DeWine signed state active duty proclamation that will activate 300 personnel from the Ohio National Guard to help with humanitarian efforts.[507]

On March 22 the Ohio Department of Health issued a stay at home order closing all non-essential businesses from March 23 at 11:59 PM until April 6.[508]

On March 23 DeWine instituted a hiring freeze for all state government positions except those involved in fighting the virus. The stay at home order signed on March 22 went into effect at 11:59 PM.[509] DeWine ordered a freeze in state hiring for all positions that are not directly related to fighting COVID-19. He also orders a freeze on contract services.[510]

On March 25, the Ohio General Assembly passed House Bill 197, which does many things, such as extending primary voting to April 28, banning water utilities from disconnecting service, and waiving standardized testing for public schools.[511][512] The bill was signed by Governor DeWeine on March 27.[512]

On March 30 DeWine extended school closure to May 1.[513]

On April 2 Dewine extended the Ohio's stay at home order through May 1 with new restrictions: campgrounds must close, all retail businesses must post signs limiting how many are allowed in at one time, and wedding receptions are limited to 10 people. The order also establishes a state board to evaluate what is and is not an essential business.[514]

On April 21, Dewine extended school closure through the remainder of the year. On May 1, a "Stay Healthy and Safe at Home" order replaced the previous stay-at-home order. Starting May 1, medical procedures that do not require an overnight stay in a hospital can proceed.[515]

On May 14, DeWine and Acton announce more re-opening dates. Campgrounds will open on May 21, horse racing will open on May 22, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), gyms, fitness centers, pools, and sports leagues (only for sports involving limited or no contact) will open on May 26, and childcare centers will re-open on May 31.[516]

On May 19, Governor DeWine announces an "Urgent Health Advisory: Ohioans protecting Ohioans" order. Elements of the previous stay-at-home order are now "strong recommendations."[517]

On May 20, Governor DeWine announces that three new orders have been signed. One order partially rescinds the April 30 Stay Safe Ohio Order, one issues a series of health advisories, and the Camp Safe Ohio Order specifies how campgrounds in Ohio can reopen.[518]

On May 21, Lt. Governor Husted announces that bowling alleys, miniature golf, and batting cages can reopen May 26, so long as they follow certain protocols. He also announces that wedding venues and banquet halls may open on June 1 with the following restrictions: there must be six feet between tables; no congregating is allowed; and crowds can have no more than 300 people.[519]
